          With our extensive experience in both residential and commercial construction, multi-family residences are a natural specialty for us. Our multi-family construction projects have encompassed various types, from small-scale duplexes and triplexes to mid-rise and larger apartment buildings, and even special-purpose multifamily properties targeting specific populations. These projects focus on energy efficiency and providing cost-effective housing solutions that maximize the return on investment for our clients.

          Full-Scope Oversight from Planning to Final Occupancy
        </h2>
        <p class="leading-7 text-brandSilver1">
          We oversee the entire multi-family construction process, from pre-construction (planning and permitting) to post-construction (final inspections and occupancy), with timelines varying based on project size. Planning and design are an intricate part of the pre-construction phase, as that’s when we consider numerous factors to support multiple units, specifically fire safety, plumbing, electrical systems, and accessibility.
          <br><br>We work in partnership with you, our client, to achieve your goals and meet all requirements. We handle all details, managing subcontractors, securing the permits, and ensuring the project stays on schedule and within budget.
